# Beta+
A mod that adds both the Alpha and Beta generators, with modern structures. This is the 1.13.2 branch of my mod, and is therefore the most "feature-complete" version. Expect the most updates to come to this branch.
# Features
* 100% accurate Beta and Alpha generation using custom-made density code.
* Modern structures, such as Ocean Monuments and Woodland Mansions.
* Deeper, climate-based Oceans.
* A custom grass and leaves model for Alpha worlds.
* A terrain simulator for accurate modern biome placement.
# Issues
Issues may be reported directly on the mod-page on Curseforge, since I do not have a dedicated way to report bugs.
# A Note on 1.12.2
I will be updating 1.12.2 branches ONLY to fix critical bugs, not to add features. For example, I will not be adding Woodland Mansions to 1.12.2 due to the immense task of backporting incongruent structure code.
